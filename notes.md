# Personal Notes made while studying for CS7NS3 - Next Generation Networks

## Lecture 1 - Wireless channel impairments and mitigation techniques

- Impairments: Phenomenom that reduce the signals strength/usefullness
- Mitigation: methods to proactively reduce impairement phenomenom

### Path Loss

- Signal attenuates with distance

  - Attenuation: reduction in force, effect or value of something
  - Roughly proportional to \frac{1}{d^2}
