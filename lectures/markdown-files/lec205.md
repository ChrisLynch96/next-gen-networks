# Wireless local area networks: HetNet and small cell deployments, mmWave

Some ways to improve capacity

- Improve the radio link efficiency (more bps)
- Get more spectrum
- Topology, meaning more nodes in the wireless network

Cell densification is a way of improving access to the network. More cells can ensure that data is served to the user in a timely manner

A homogenous network in terms cell distribution would be one where all users in a cell limit are only connected to that cell. There is a strict boundary. Users at the cell edge could suffer.

A heterogeneous network in terms of cell distribution is one where one could have small-cell base stations (femto/pico cells) which can connect to users in adjacent cells i.e being in the confines of one cell does not mean you connect to the base station of that cell as it is possible for small-cell base stations from adjacent cells to serve you. This improves the connection for users at the cell edge.

Heterogeneous networks:

- improve coverage for users at the edge of a cell
- Higher throughput

Throughput is upper bounded and so adding more femto cell (the little guys) does not necessarily mean greater throughput. This could be due to the number of users in a given cell boundary. That number is limited.

I'm fairly sure **HetNet** stands for Heterogeneous Network

## Interference

Nodes all share the same frequency bandwidth and use OFDMA

There can be inter cell interference where a femto interferes with a macro cell and vice versa i.e they're both trying to connect to the same user

A PAN is a network of personal devices, think your phone and its peripherals such as a smart watch. Here one device could assume the role of the master device/AP and the other personal devices communicate with this device to perform any functions or external network actions.

I think Macro Base stations have Fixed frequencies vs. Pico cells and their flexible frequency use

## Spectrum

Reuse 3:1 means that the macro base station uses one third of the bandwidth and the pico stations use all the bandwidth

## mmWave

micro-metre seems to be up to 3GHz and from 3GHz onwards (maybe up to 300GHz) is the millimetre-wave band

Huge amount of available spectrum

mmWave is used in:

- VANET
- LAN
- PAN
- Backhaul in cellular networks

From what I can tell Backhauling is referring to getting the data to a point in the network where it can be distributed.

Blockage is a bug impairment for millimeter wave. LOS is needed for ideal communication

Implications:

- Need a high base station density
- Indoor users don't get coverage
- Blockages reduce the impact of interference
- Very high data rates for mmWave
- Mobility may be a challenge
