# lec 2.04: Wireless local area networks: IEEE 802.11

## Motivations

- Simplicity: easy to install and manage
- Ad-Hoc planning - no cable required
- Nomadic user support
- Robustness: weak dependence on infrastructure
- Spontaneous Deployment: Can create networks on the fly
- Cost

## Limitations

Quality of service

- Lower throughput than wired
- limited support for service differentiation or guarantees

Regulatory issues

- Limitations on maximum transit power
- Operate in ISM bands (Industrial, Scientific and Medical)

Coexistence

- Multiple Standards (802.11a, 802.11b/g, Bluetooth, etc.)
- Overlapping frequency bands

Security

- easy to eavesdrop

## Goals

1. Global operation
2. Low Power
3. Robustness
4. Interoperability
5. Security
6. Application support

Global Operation

- coordination of international spectrum regulation
- License-free operation

Low Power

- Limited battery life without recharging
- Safety consideration, don't disturb ISM communications

Robustness

- Overcome impairments in the wireless medium
- Support for nomadicity

Interoperability

- WLAN/wireline networks; WLAN/WWAN (e.g 802.11/3G-4G); WLAN/WPAN (e.g 802.11/bluetooth)

Security

- privacy, robustness, denial of service

Application support

## Infrared vs Radio

- Infrared is only good for short range, direct, point-to-point communication
- Infrared can used diffused reflected light (Light that has been bouncing off surfaces) but generally it is ideal to have a line of sight.
- Infrared is inexpensive, requires no license and does not experience interference with other electronics.

- Radio will give a long term experience, the waves can travel long distances and penetrate obstacles, also has a much higher data rate

## Infrastructure vs ad-hoc

In an infrastructure scenario there would be an AP responsible for forwarding messages, flow control etc. The AP is the gateway to the network. This is good for hotspots, firewalls, office WLANs etc.

In an ad-hoc scenario each device can communicate with each other and perform routing functions. It is a peer to peer connection and is useful for military scenarios, IoT and Vehicular networks

For multi-hop communication the ad-hoc nodes must be running some sort of routing protocol

## WiFi/802.11

Wi-Fi: Wireless fidelity

Wi-Fi alliance certifies the interoperability of 802.11 products

The original base 802.11 uses Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)

### 802.11b

- Higher speed physical layer extension of 802.11 in the 2.4 GHz band
- Data rates of 11, 5.5, 2 and 1 Mbps
- In practice the maximum achievable user data rate is 6-7 Mbps
- Lowest cost
- Longest range as with 802.11g
- Other appliances can interfere in the same frequency band
- The channel width is 22MHz
- 14 channels
- Uses DSSS

### 802.11a

- Operates in the 5GHz band
- **Not directly compatible with 802.11b or 802.11g (different bands)**
- Shorter range
- 12 non-overlapping channels
- Uses OFDM to achieve up to 54Mbps
- Can be expensive
- Not compatible with 802.11a/b
- Supports more simultaneous users than b

20MHz spacing between channels in 802.11a

802.11a makes use of 52 equally spaced sub-carriers around a centre frequency. Four of the carriers are used for pilot detection (signal detection)

#### OFDM

- Technique used to distribute data over several carriers spaced apart at precise intervals.

Look at the LTE notes for a more in depth description

### 802.11g

- Tries to combine the best features of both 802.11b and 802.11a
- Data rates from 20_ Mbps up to 54Mbps
- 2.4GHz band
- Interoperable with 802.11b
- Longest range as with 802.11b
- operated in the 2.4Ghz band
- OFDM

### 802.11n

- Uses MIMO to achieve a higher data rate
- Physical rate up to 600 Mbps
- Operates in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands

### 802.11ad (WiGig)

- New kid on the block
- Data rate up to 7 Gbps
- 60 GHz  ISM band
  - Large Bandwidth
  - Reduced Interference
- Range ~ few metres
  - Used for the transfer of very short range, high volumes of data
