# Fixed Access Networks

Core is the trunk of the network, the main part that is least likely to change. Transports data between metro networks

Metro is the main branches from the core, here customers might start being served for example an ISP

Access is the part of the network which changes that most, this is the individual customers coming onto and going off the network

Infrastructural changes to the network happen from the core outwards.

## Aggregation

At the access layer it could be ~ 1 fibre connection per user

The users get aggregated in the metro connection

Finally at the core level you could have 1M - 100M+ connections per fibre

But the Aggregation times access capacity is greater than the actual capacity because only a few users are using the link at any one time.

Statistical multiplexing is used to figure out how much capacity should be available on a given link to make sure that users have access most of the time.

## Issues in the access layer

- Cost per connection is quite high when compared to the metro and core layers

Must try to reduce the distance of copper cabling to reduce attenuation

Transmission technologies:

1. ADSL
2. ADSL-2
3. ADSL-2+
4. VDSL
5. VDSL2
6. G.fast
7. XG.fast

## DSL details

- ADSL occupies up to 1.1 MHz bandwidth, using Discrete Multi-Tone Modulation (DMT - similar to OFDM) with 256 channels
- ADSL-2 also occupies up to 1.1 MHz bandwidth, using DMT but improving modulation efficiency, reducing framing overhead, ...
- ADSL-2+ occupies up to 2.2 MHz bandwidth, using DMT – Achieves up to 24 Mb/s DS, 3.3 Mb/s US

## FTTC

Replacing the copper from the central office to a cabinet closer to the end users

The distance of copper is now on average ~ 500m

Attenuation is dealt with but there is a high SNR ration reducing the effectiveness.

FTTC uses a twisted copper pair in some part of the network

The copper is a twisted pair and VDSL/VDSL2 are used

### VDSL/VDSL2

Down 52Mbps Up 16Mpbps for VDSL using frequencies up to 12 MHz

VDSL2 uses higher frequencies (up to 30MHz) in order to achieve a symmetric 100Mbps

Using a higher frequency has the consequence of a shorter reach

### Vectoring

Significant portion of noise in line is due to radiation from adjacent twisted copper pairs. Otherwise referred to as cross-talk between adjacent copper pairs

vectoring is a way of removing cross-talk at the cabinet to counteract the noise the line is expected to receive on its journey.

The noise will be measured at the termination point, the users house for example. Then xTalk information is sent back to the cabinet. Using this xTalk information the cabinet generates anti-noise to counteract the noise that the signal is expected to receive on its journey.

## G.fast

G.fast uses a much larger bandwidth, 106MHz. Overlaps with Radio, VDSL etc.

Duplex in the time domain, so this means the DS/US ration can change (e.g 90/10 or 50/50)

distances of up to 500m

Degrades faster than other fixed access technologies

## Fibre to the Distribution point (FTTDp)

One step further than FTTC, replacing the copper all the way to the distribution point

Average distance ~50-100m

Also referred to as Fibre-To-The-Building (FTTB) (think the fibre reaching the office and copper doing to rest)

FTTDp uses G.fast

## XG.fast

Still being researched

Speeds up to 10Gbps over very short copper distance

- It uses bandwidth up to 500MHz
- Bonding: use of two copper pairs per users (where available)
- Phantom mode: create a third virtual pair of two physical copper pairs
- Advanced cross-talk cancellation
- Full-Duplex transmission (FDX): use same bandwidth both DS and US with echo cancellation

Uses two twisted copper pairs and a third virtual pair. The virtual pair is just treating the original two pairs as another twisted copper pair

If you are at the *drop* that means that you are alone and do not run together with any other users. There is no cross-talk

Vectoring is used to cancel echo within the copper pair and to cancel cross-talk between multiple pairs of the same user

## FTTH

Fibre all the way to the house

Technology

- Point-to-Point
- Passive Optical Networks (PON)

## Point to point

- Independent fibres
- User with potential to have whole fibre bandwidth

But

- Very expensive in both deployment and local exchange (one termination point per user)
- User won't benefit from the whole fibre bandwidth due to network bandwidth aggregation

The typical technology used is Gigabit Ethernet (GE) over fibre or in some cases 10GE

## Passive Optical Networks (PONs)

The idea is to share the optical fibre into a tree structure using passive optical splitters

This allows one Optical Line Terminal (OLT) to serve many Optical Network Units (ONUs) at the user side

### Time Division Multiplexing PON (TDM-PON)

The protocol is based on TDM/TDMA

Downstream the OLT broadcasts data to every ONU, and each ONU filters out the data destined to it

In the upstream the data will converge into the same link to the OLT

- In the upstream direction a MAC is implemented to avoid collision of signals from different ONUs

The downstream signal is achieved through broadcast, the ONUs filter out the packets destined for them. The signal is continuous and the receivers are not expensive.

The access to the upstream channel is TDMA

The OLT receiver operates in “burst-mode”, i.e. it receives short burst of data. A burst-mode receiver is much more complex and expensive than a continuous-mode one

The Downstream and upstream frames is scrambled to as to avoid any synchronization issues (a sequence of too many ones or zeros causing de-synchronization)

de scrambling occurs at the receiver

Downstream is a continuous stream of data

Upstream is a burst structure. The OLT receives bursts of data. More expensive and complicated

## Dynamic BandWidth Assignment (DBA)

DBA is the process by which the OLT decides how to assign upstream transmission opportunities (e.g., bandwidth) to the ONUs

The mechanism works by either:

1. Status Reporting - Where the ONU informs the OLT of the bandwidth it requires
2. Traffic monitoring - Where the OLT assigns bandwidth based off of traffic patterns

Each ONU will usually also receive a small fixed bandwidth. Followed by a variable bandwidth that is assigned based on demand

The variable bandwidth is made up of two components:

1. Guaranteed: This is always available for the ONU when needed
2. Additional: Can be assigned if their is enough spare bandwidth available

## Ranging

The ONUs are not equidistant from the OLT and this needs to be accounted for. Packets could overlap otherwise. A ranging operation takes place when a ONU joins the PON

There are multiple phases to ranging

### Phase 1: ONU Registration

1. The OLT sends a halt msg to all ONUs to stop upstream transmission
2. OLT request serial number to unregistered ONU(s)
3. After receiving the request, an unregistered ONU transmits the serial number after waiting for a random time (up to 48 $\mu$s)
4. The OLT registers the ONU assigning it an ONU-ID value

A ranging window sets the limit on the distance from an OLT to an ONU, for GPON this is 20km => 200$\micro{}s$

### Phase 2: Round Trip Delay (RTD) to the ONU

1. OLT sends a halt msg to all ONUs to stop upstream transmission
2. OLT sends a Ranging request to a specific ONU (using ONU-ID)
3. The ONU with that ONU-ID sends back a Ranging message to OLT
4. OLT calculates the RTD for that ONU and notifies the ONU of its Equalization Delay(=Teqd-RTD), where Teqd is max RTD (e.g., 200$\mu$s)
5. The ONU stores the Equalization delay and uses it for all upstream transmissions

## Duplex Scheme and Split Ratios

Wavelength Division Duplex (WDD) is the most economically convenient duplex over a single fibre

A Split ratio is the number of ONUs that can be served by an OLT

The Higher the split ratio the

- Better the cost benefit
- Less capacity per user
- Greater the optical loss

GPON allows a split ration from 1:16 up to 1:64, and a max ONU-OLT distance of 20km

### Security Issues

OLTs physically broadcast messages and the ONUs filter messages meaning that a malicious ONU could eavesdrop on messages not meant for it.

Cryptography could fix this issue. Using an initial key that is pre-established

Not an issue on the upstream

## WDM-PON

Each user is given a wavelength channel and a WDM splitter in the cabinet separates the wavelengths into their own fibre.

Logically a point-to-point solution

channel would normally use 1GE or 10GE

The wavelength is fixed so there is little to no room for arbitrary capacity allocation

## TWDM-PON

Same as TDM-PON but now the one fibre has multiple wavelengths over it.

ONUs have tuneable lasers, meaning the ONU can tune their laser and filtering to select different OLTs

- If an OLT is congested, the ONUs can choose a different OLT
- A ONU could have a logical PtP connection to an OLT for the time taken to complete a service

Passive splitters and tunable end point is the most flexible solution as it can offer very different capacity, on demand, to different type of users

## Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)

The faster (on average) provider in Ireland right now is Virgin Media, who provide a copper service...

They achieve this by using coaxial copper cables, previously left around from the days of cabled TV (No infrastructure setup cost)

DOCSIS: Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification

Basically Fibre runs some of the route before it reaches an optical node where the old cable network kicks in. New protocols are being used over this network to achieve faster speeds 

- DOCSIS 3.1 could theoretically reach 10Gb
- DOCSIS 3.0 can reach 1372.16
- DOCSIS 2.0 can reach 42.88
- DOCSIS 1.0 can reach 42.88

## Socio-Economic issues

EU goal (2020) of 30-100Mbps in every household and 100-1000Mbps in 50% of households

- Government subsidises the operator but network must be shared (foster/force competition)

Regulators can force the most significant player in the market to build the infrastructure and then also to share that infrastructure at a price determined by the regulator

## Access Network Sharing

- Copper Access
  - Local Loop Unbundling (LLU)
  - Sub Loop Unbundling (SLU)
  - Bitstream
  - Virtual Unbundling line access (VULA)
  - Bitstream Next Generation Access (NGA)

### Local Loop Unbundling (LLU)

Local loop is the transmission medium from the central office to the end users

LLU gives new Other Licensed Operators (OLOs) access to the previous national operators network (incumbent operator)

The OLO is physically connecting its end user to its own equipment in the central office

The equipment either terminates there at the office OR is multiplexed to the OLOs core network

Local Loop Unbundling is expensive - requires more new equipment for their users

### Sub Loop Unbundling (SLU)

Local Loop Unbundling deals with sharing of the copper from the cabinet to the user

The OLO would terminate the twister copper pair of an end user at its cabinet

This creates issues in vectoring. Efficient vectoring can not be achieved anymore as the OLOs are terminating the cable elsewhere. The cross-processing that takes place in vectoring is not possible anymore.

### Bitstream access

involves the creation of virtual circuits so that an OLO can offer broadband to an end user through a virtual circuit

The virtual circuit is created using Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs)

OLO has no physical infrastructure to provide

- Reduced capital cost
- Increased competition

BitStream doesn't allow operators to fully control their service

OLOs can not differentiate their service, all users receive the same bandwidth

### Virtual Unbundling Line Access (VULA)

With VULA OLOs can differentiate their service by

- Putting the interconnection at the first aggregation point
- Having uncontended access between user and interconnection point
- Being able to decide quality of service parameters
- Being in control of the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)

The OLO can also put the interconnection point in the central office. This does require more investment from the OLOs but provides them with greater control ove the service offered.

### Next Generation Access (NGA) Bitstream

It provides a way for OLOs to avoid the need to interconnect at every Local Exchange, while offering better service than legacy bitstream

The interconnection points acn be Metro, Regional or National PoPs

Improvements

- Higher bit rates and FTTH technology
- IPTV
- Multicast
- Layer2 access
- Traffic QoS classification
- Ability for the user to subscribe to multiple OLOs

## PON unbundling

Point-to-point fibre is easy as it allows for LLU but its also expensive

All you need to know is that Power-split is the way to go for these reasons

- OLOs can operate at specific wavelengths were end users can subscribe by tuning
- Capacity assignment is quite arbitrary, as OLOs can decrease the number of users per PON dynamically to give more capacity
- OLOs can assign more than one wavelength to a user, if the user has ONUs with more transceivers
- Lowest cost

With the wavelength approach each user must have an individual port with which to terminate and there is very little flexibility
